## üéØ How It Works

AutoAnimate automatically detects when DOM elements are:

- **Removed** from the page  
- **Moved** to different positions

It then applies smooth CSS transitions to make these changes visually appealing.

### React Hook Usage
```typescript
import { useAutoAnimate } from '@formkit/auto-animate/react';

// In your component
const [animateRef] = useAutoAnimate();

// Apply to container element
<div ref={animateRef}>
  {items.map(item => <ItemComponent key={item.id} />)}
</div>
```
